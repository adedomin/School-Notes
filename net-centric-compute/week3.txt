sockets are like doors: serve as means to communicate with software at application level

IPC = inter process communication

messages

	requests -> response

syntax

	how data is delineated

semantics

	meaning of information

rules

	how to request/respond

transport services

	data integrity - reliability reqs
		TCP, file transfer

	timing - real time, delayed?

	throughput - req minimum? no?

	security - verification, encryption

transport protocols:

	TCP

		Reliable transit

		flow control - don't overwhelm receiver

		congestion control - tell sender to slow down

		DOES NOT

			minimum throughput, timing, security

		connection oriented - client - server handshake	

	UDP

		none of the above

		less data overhead

		simple

Stateless

	past client requests are meaningless
	no recollection

	maintaining state is complex

non-persistent

	one object per connection

	connection closed at end

persistent

	multiple object over single tcp connection between clent server

RTT - round trip time

	time to go from point a to b to a

	one rtt to initiate tcp connection

	one to request and get a response

	+ file transfer time

	2 RTT + file transit time

persistent http means less RTT
