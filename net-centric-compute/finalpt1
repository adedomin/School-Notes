May 6th, fnal due

one more HW assign


ROUTING

	link state

	distance vector

		creates forward table

	graph theory N E

		N nodes

		E is set of link

	looking for least cost route
	
	dijkstra's

		broadcast, all know

		distance[source] <- 0;
		previous[source] <- unknown

		foreach node in graph
			if node != source:
				distance[node] <- infinity
				previous[node] <- unknown
			N'.append(node);
		
		foreach node in N':


	A*

	Global

		All routers know network topology

	Distance

		only know 

	Autonoumous systems - Hierarchy routing

		manage internal routing, obfuscate other systems


Intra-AS

	Open Shortest Path First

		dijkstra

	Routing Information Protocol

		Bellman-Ford 


Inter - Autonoumous Systems

	Border Gate Protocol
		
		Hot potato
