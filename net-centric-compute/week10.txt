Chapter 4 - Network Layer

Service Models

forwarding -> moving packets to different networks

routing -> dictates forwarding path

how a router works

routing -> determines route, who to forward to

broadcast, multicast


VIRTUAL CIRCUIT and DATAGRAM NET

	Guaranteed bandwidth?
	packet jitter?
		Jitter -> faster or slower than expected
	loss free?
	in order delivery
	
	IP  & TCP/UDP & no guarantees, best effort

	ATM & CBR     & constant speed, ordered, no loss

	ATM & VBR

	virtual circuit -> connection, network layer, service
	Datagram -> connectionless service

	VIRTUAL CIRCUIT - X.25, ATM

		call setup, teardown, like TCP.
		packets are identified by VC identifier.
		routers maintain statefullness.
		dedicated resources, guaranteed performance

		VC number can change constantly based on forward table

		Virtual circuits remove the need for processing packets and allow for pure byte streams between end systems


IPv4 -> 32  bits
IPv6 -> 128 bits

Routing

	Forwarding table

		algo makes table
		header is checked to determine next forwarding target
		longest prefix match

			find address that is closest to matching range.

Routers
	       routing proc
	             A
				 |
				 V
	Inputs -> Switch -> Outputs

	Input

		line terminator
		Link layer (recv)
		Lookup, forwarding (buffer)

	Switch fabrics

		input/output rates
		N inputs -> switch rate N times faster for desiredspeed

		Memory
			as fast as memory bandwidth + bus delay * 2
		BUS
			switch speed limited by bus bandwidth, one bus traversal
		Crossbar
			overcomes bus limitation
			allows for data to pick dedicated routes
			semaphore like networking

	Output

		buffer if data gets sent in too fast
		link layer send
		line terminator

	Buffer sizes

		\frac{RTT \times Capacity}{sqrt{N}}
		

Internet Protocol

	Internet Net layer

	addressing, datagrams, forwarding table

	ICMP

		error, debugging, router signaling

	header - 32bit long

		version, head length, type of service, length

		16 bit ident, flags, fragment offset

		time to live, upper layer, header checksum

		32bit address - source

		32bit address - destination

		options

		DATA

	IP Adress

		binary, 32bit number separated by 8 bits into 4 subnets

		subnet, least significant byte

		denoted by /1-31

		CIDR - Classless InterDomain Routing
			
			subnet portion of net

			address from FF.FF.FF.FF/#bits

		DHCP

			server allocates address on the fly
